My contribute to the group is to visualize the tabular data of the citibike median age and the coordinates of the bike stations on the map.  For the mapping purpose, I had to create a new table of borough names, bike station id and coordinates using python code. In argGIS, I counted the number of stations in each neighbourhood in Manhattan and Brooklyn, mapped the stations onto the map with the median age of each station shown as a circle of different size.
