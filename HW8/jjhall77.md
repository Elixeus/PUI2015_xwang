### The plot looks quite good at first sight: it seems that there is a strong negative correlation between the population size and the carbon emission per capita. However, improvement in several aspects could help the graph convey the idea even more efficiently:
### 1. Titles and x,y labels can use a larger fontsize;
### 2. The colors chosen can be a trouble for the color blind readers. Deuteranopia readers will have a hard time distinguishing Metropolitan and Micropolitan areas. Instead of different colors, the author might consider different shades of the same color to convey the contrast to the color blind readers.
### 3. The scale at both x and y axis are not 'honest' in the sense that the actual distance between every two numbers(say, the distance betweem 10**(-1) and 10**(-2) and that between 10**(-2) and 10**(-3) are not the same). When plotted at the normal scale, the plots would actually cloud together, and not such a strong negative correlation would be observed.
