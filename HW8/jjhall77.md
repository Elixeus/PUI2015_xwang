### In general the plot expresses the information quite clearly: it seems that there is a strong negative correlation between the population size and the carbon emission per capita. However, improvement in several aspects could help the graph convey the idea even more efficiently:
### 1. Titles and x,y labels can use a larger fontsize;
### 2. The colors chosen can be a trouble for the color blind readers. Deuteranopia readers will have a hard time distinguishing Metropolitan and Micropolitan areas. Instead of different colors, the author might consider different shades of the same color to convey the contrast to the color blind readers.
