# Peer Review for Casyfill

### The graph is both functionally beautiful and informative. However, 3 improvements could be made to convey the information even better:
### 1. The information shown by the y axis would be much clear if y label could be added and relative ticks could be added. Adding the y label and redirecting the reader to the readme.md would be more informative.
### 2. Instead of splitting the information between the title and the extra line below the graph, it would be better to put all the information in the graph so the reader can catch the whole picture very quickly.
