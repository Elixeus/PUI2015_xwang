good reviews, attentive and insightful 10/10

NOTES ON PLOT 
==============

[!alt text](Xia.png)

the plot is clear, the label visible. 

the default choice for python large number visualization is questionable and could be changed (the 1e7 at the top is hard to notice

contrast is lost by color blind people

the legend is unclear. "10t" is not explained. the default 3 datapoints for scatter plot should be changes as it is unnecessarily redundant


NOTES OF THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
==========================================

Casyfill
=========
the kind of plot that makes tufte happy. 
the author should make the python implementation public in a nice python module!
the color choices are not terribly good for color blind compliance.

what is the number at the top left of each row? not describes in the readme.

===========
the colors are not explained nor is the transparency

for the large numbers on x and y axis a more concise notation should be chosen

the 3d dimension is unnecessary and possibly redundant with the color. 

the 3d dimension makes the readability of the Square footage and of the # of units hard to read away from the edges of the respective axis ranges

======


tick and axis labels are too small

the colors indicate the structure in the data nicely but the three shades are not distinguishable by people affected by the most common color blind variety

in general the default 3 datapoints in the legend should be substitute with a single point, as they are redundant, but in this case since the datapoints are small to allow to see the overlapping structure (presumably) the three datapoints are justified. 

10^0 should be replaced with 1, 10^1 with 10
