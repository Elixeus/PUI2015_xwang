### The plot should be improved in several ways to achieve a much better communication with the readers:
### 1. There is no title for the graph. The reader don't know what the graph wants to express.
### 2. 3D graphs are much harder to interprete than the 2D graphs. It is difficult to figure out the positions of the dots. The third dimensional information coulb be expressed in other ways, such as using different symbols.
### 3. There is no legend explaining what category each color represents.
### 4. The colors used don't have enough contrast so the color blind readers can have a better
### 5. The x, y, z labels could have larger fontsize.
